## Change-log

2.4.0
- Added controls for allowing 90-degree left/right camera rotation.
-- These are NOT binded to any default-keys, so remember to check your game Options->Controls.
-- Suggested by dertien due to using TrackIR. And it seemed to be an easy addition to the code.

2.3.1
- Polish translation updated/fixed by Ziuta

2.3.0
- Camera can now be changed, even if hired worker is turned on.
  - Credits to jules.stmp537 for finding a solution for that problem.
